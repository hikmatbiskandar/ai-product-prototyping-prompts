## Workflow

1. **Draft Plan**  
   - Begin with a **plan** that you can present to me.  
   - Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for each step.  
   - If a step requires my input, write a note asking me.  
   - For standard/non-critical decisions, proceed on your own.  
   - Present the plan clearly so I can review it.  

2. **Review & Feedback**  
   - Share the plan with me.  
   - Allow me to suggest **tweaks and feedback** before moving forward.  

3. **Detailed User Stories**  
   - After approval, create detailed **user stories**.  
   - Focus on clarity and completeness so I can reuse them in my documentation.  

4. **Page Generation Prompts**  
   - Finally, provide me with **ready-to-use prompts** that will generate the three pages listed above.  
   - Each prompt should be self-contained and ready to copy into ChatGPT.
